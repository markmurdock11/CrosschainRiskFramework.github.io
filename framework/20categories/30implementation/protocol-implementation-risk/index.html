  <h1>Protocol implementation risk</h1>

<h2 id="protocol-implementation-risk">Protocol Implementation Risk</h2>
<p>The design of contracts and code implementation changes the risk 
profile of the project. This section discusses design features 
and then works through software development implementation risks.</p>
<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE mixing-control-data-flow.md -->
<h3 id="mixing-of-control-and-data-plane">Mixing of Control and Data Plane</h3>
<p>The terms <em>Control Plane</em> and <em>Data Plane</em> come from networking [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_plane">Wikipedia</a>]. In the
context of networking, the Control Plane configures the network topology 
and routing tables, and the Data Plane is the information that is 
communicated across the network. In the context of computing, the 
Control Plane is the configuration of the system, and the Data Plane
is the data processing. </p>
<p>Functions in smart contracts can be ones that control the configuration 
of the contract. These can be thought of as Control Plane functions. 
For example, a function to pause the contract is a Control Plane function. 
Data Plane functions are functions that process data. For example, a 
function to mint some tokens is a Data Plane function.</p>
<p>Poor project design can result in smart contract functions that contain 
both Control Plane and Data Plane logic. Mixing these two planes in the 
one function dramatically increases the risk of the project. An attacker 
may be able to compromise the Data Plane part of a mixed processing function, 
and then use that to change the configuration of the project, accessing the 
Control Plane part of the mixed function. This can lead to the attacker 
having the ability to control aspects of the project such as minting tokens.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>As example of this type of issue being exploited is the 
<a href="https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/">August 2021 PolyNetwork issue</a>. The 
PolyNetwork code was written such that its <strong>EthCrossChainManager</strong> contract
was the owner of the <strong>EthCrossChainData</strong> contract. The <strong>EthCrossChainData</strong> 
contract held important information including the public keys used to verify
crosschain requests. Doing this allows for function calls for <strong>EthCrossChainData</strong>
to go via the <strong>EthCrossChainManager</strong> contract. Access from the <strong>EthCrossChainManager</strong> contract
to the <strong>EthCrossChainData</strong> contract could be deemed part of the Control Plane. 
The <strong>EthCrossChainManager</strong> contract also had a function 
<strong>verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx</strong> that was used to process  Data Plane requests. 
The attacker was able to create a carefully constructed call to
<strong>verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx</strong> that allowed the Data Plane request to modify
data in the <strong>EthCrossChainData</strong>, that ultimately led to the attacker being 
able to steal funds. </p>
<p>The PolyNetwork code would not have been vulnerable to this type 
of attack if there had been a clear separation of Control Plane and Data 
Plane. For example, rather than doing updates to the <strong>EthCrossChainData</strong> 
contract via the <strong>EthCrossChainManager</strong> contract, updates could have been 
only allowed from an Externally Owned Account (EOA) or a MultiSig Wallet
account.</p>
<!-- END INCLUDE -->

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE pause.md -->
<h3 id="ability-to-pause-project">Ability to Pause Project</h3>
<p>All Data Plane functions should be <em>pausable</em>. For example, a bridge contract could 
have a function that could transfer coins based on actions on another blockchain. 
The ability to <em>pause</em> a function in a 
project allows administrators to stop functions from successfully 
executing. If there is a vulnerability that is being actively 
exploited in a project, having the ability to pause a function 
could stop the exploitation of the project midway through the 
attack.</p>
<p>For Ethereum based projects, the OpenZeppelin project has an example 
 contract <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/Pausable.sol">Pausable.sol</a>
that can be used to implement pausing. Using this template, 
pausing a function becomes as simple as adding a modifier <code>whenNotPaused</code>. 
The code below shows how this would work in practice.</p>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">contract Example is Pausable {
    function pause() external onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }
    function transfer(
        address _sender,
        address _tokenContract,
        address _recipient,
        uint256 _amount
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        // Only executed when not paused
</code></pre>
<p>When analyzing whether a project can be paused, it is important
to check whether all data processing functions can be paused, or
just some parts of the project. </p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example_1">Example</h4>
<p>For example, in <a href="https://medium.com/nomad-xyz-blog/nomad-bridge-hack-root-cause-analysis-875ad2e5aacd">August 2022 the Nomad Bridge</a> had an issue
(see <a href="https://rekt.news/nomad-rekt/">Rekt</a> for an analysis of the issue from 
people outside the team).
An attacker was able to determine a methodology for stealing funds using the <code>Replica</code> 
contract's <code>process()</code> function. Depite most of the Data Plane processing functions 
in the project being pausable, the <code>process()</code> function was not. This meant that the 
attack was able to proceed without the administrators of the project being able to stop it. </p>
<!-- END INCLUDE -->

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE access-control.md -->
<h3 id="role-based-access-control">Role Based Access Control</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</a> 
allows different entites to be responsible for different configuration actions. 
Systems that are managed by a single entity are inherently less secure 
than those with narrowly-scoped privileges for different entities and specific contexts.</p>
<p>With 
contracts, this can be used to limit which accounts can execute which functions. For 
example, imagine a contract that operates as a crosschain bridge. It could have a role 
called <strong>PAUSER</strong>. This role could be required to call a function that enables 
pausing of the contract. Any transaction submitted by an account that did not 
have the <strong>PAUSER</strong> role would be reverted.</p>
<p>Simplistic contracts might have a single role, <strong>OWNER</strong>, that can only be assigned
to one account. For these contracts, the <strong>owner</strong> account is the only account 
that can submit transactions that call configuration functions without reverting.</p>
<p>The greater degree of flexibility afforded by Role Based Access Control compared 
to simplistic <strong>OWNER</strong> style access control has security implications. For example, 
a contract might be able to mint new tokens, and thus have a <strong>MINTER</strong> role to control
this action. Minting new tokens could change the tokenomics of the contract, and hence 
must only be executed if there is agreement between administrators. Access to this 
configuration action might be limited to a multi-signature wallet account. The same 
contract might have a <strong>PAUSER</strong> role that can be used to stop data processing within 
the contract. The action to pause the contract needs to occur as quickly as possible,
to halt an in-progress attack. However, access to the role needs to be limited to trusted
accounts, to prevent attackers causing a Denial of Service attack on the contract, by
continually pausing the contract. Using a multi-signature wallet to control this action
is not ideal, as multiple parties would need to work together to pause the contract, thus 
allowing attacks to continue longer than they otherwise would. In this situation, 
multiple trusted accounts could be granted <strong>PAUSER</strong> role. Any one of the accounts 
could then pause the contract.</p>
<p>For a small project, when a contract is deployed, it might be tempting to use 
simplistic <strong>OWNER</strong> style access control. 
However, it is better to deploy a contract configured for fine grain
Role Based Access Control, where all roles are initially assigned to the one account.
In this way, as the project using the contract matures, new accounts can be granted
roles and the original account's access can be revoked.
It should be noted that the benefits of RBAC are only realised once 
access for different roles is allocated to additional accounts. </p>
<p>For Ethereum based projects, the OpenZeppelin project has an example
contract <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol">AccessControl.sol</a>
that can be used to implement Role Based Access Control. Using this template,
checking an address has been granted a role becomes as simple as calling 
the function <strong>hasRole</strong>.
The code below shows how this would work in practice.</p>
<pre><code class="language-solidity">contract Example is Pausable, AccessControl {
    constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _setupRole(PAUSER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    function pause() external {
        require(hasRole(PAUSER_ROLE, msg.sender), &quot;Must have PAUSER role&quot;);
        _pause();
    }
}

<h3 id="upgradable">Upgradable</h3>
<p>TODO: This needs some thought.</p>
<p>Upgrading can lead to rug-pulling, possibly by attackers who gain access to the address with upgrade privileges.
However, code often has bugs. Additionally, new features can be added. Hence, the ability to upgrade is important.
Are different upgrade mechanisms more and less risky?</p>

<h3 id="ability-to-ban-addresses">Ability to Ban Addresses</h3>
<p>Addresses may be associated with stolen funds. Tornado Cash was 
a project that had sanctions placed against it due to its 
association with stolen funds. Projects that have the 
ability to block these addresses, or freeze in-transit funds 
are more likely to avoid this type of regulatory risk.</p>

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE known-platform.md -->
<h3 id="well-known-platform">Well Known Platform</h3>
<p>More people are likely to be able to review and understand projects 
that are created in environments that they are familiar with. The 
majority of the blockchain developers in the world understand 
Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Hence, projects 
that use blockchains that support the EVM, or that are forks or 
Ethereum, are inherently less risky than projects that involve 
other blockchains.</p>
<!-- END INCLUDE -->

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE known-language.md -->
<h3 id="well-known-smart-contract-programming-language">Well Known Smart Contract Programming Language</h3>
<p>More people are likely to be able to review and understand code 
that has been created in programming languages that they are 
familiar with. Solidity is the smart contract programming 
language known by most blockchain developers. Hence, projects 
that use Solidity are inherently less risky than projects that 
use other smart contract programming languages.</p>
<p>Solidity Assembler can be used to implement complex features not 
available in standard Solidity. Assembler code is more complex 
than Solidity code and is more likely to contain bugs and have 
unexpected consequences.</p>

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE open-source.md -->
<h3 id="open-source-code">Open Source Code</h3>
<p>If the code is stored in a public Github repository, it allows people 
to review the code and the test system. If many people view the code, 
then it is likely that defects in the code will be found. Additionally, 
it allows for the assessment of such things as the number of tests.</p>
<p>Some people argue that a private Github repository is more secure, 
believing that issues can be hidden from attackers. However, 
attackers who are sufficiently motivated often obtain access 
of private repository or to a copy of the code, and are then 
able to exploit any vulnerabilities. Not having the repository 
public then hinders white hat developers from helping, in the 
case of an attack.</p>
<p>When using a public repository, it is important that issues that 
relate to vulnerabilities and code fixes for vulnerabilities are 
not put on the public repository before a release including the 
vulnerability fix has been deployed. Not doing this equates to 
publishing vulnerabilities that can be used to exploit the 
project. The approach that should be taken is to review and 
test the vulnerability fix using the private repo, deploy 
from the private repo, and the push the fix to the public 
repo. </p>

Not being able to determine what code have been deployed reduces the trust 
stakeholders have in the project. </p>

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE testing.md -->
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Code that is not tested is far more likely to contain bugs 
than code that has been tested. Comprehensive tests allow 
new features to be added without fear of breaking existing 
functionality. Hence, the more comprehensive the testing of 
the project, the less risky the project is. </p>

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE formal-verification.md -->
<h3 id="formal-verification">Formal Verification</h3>
<p>Formally verified code should prove that the code matches the 
specification. Hence, formal verification can not detect bugs 
in the design of the project. However, it will pick-up 
implementation bugs that testing might miss.</p>
<!-- END INCLUDE -->

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE documentation.md -->
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>More documentation makes a project easier to analyze. A lack 
of documentation can lead to confusion and issues being 
missed. Projects that have good documentation are easier 
to maintain.</p>
<p>Types of documentation a good project should have are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture document that includes the component and deployment architecture.</li>
<li>Thread model that includes all parts of the project.</li>
<li>Sequence diagrams for all major data flows.</li>
<li>Test plan describing how the project will be tested.</li>
<li>Smart contract code comments at the contract and function level.</li>
<li>Off-chain code with comments at the class and method level.</li>
<li>Test code with at least a class level comment.</li>
</ul>

<!-- BEGIN INCLUDE secret-storage.md -->
<h3 id="secret-storage">Secret Storage</h3>
<p>Most projects use cryptographic keys to operate the system. 
These keys could be stored in a network HSM or a hardware 
wallet, and not in a file on disk on a server. </p>
